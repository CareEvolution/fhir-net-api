The Hl7.Fhir.Core library has been renamed to CareEvolution.Fhir.Core. This package is empty, but will install the new package.

Alternatively you can use the official Hl7.Fhir.DSTU2 or Hl7.Fhir.STU3 packages - that support those specific FHIR versions, as opposed to CareEvolution.Fhir.Core that supports both at the same time.
